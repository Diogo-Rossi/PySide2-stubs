General TODO:
=============
- Signal.connect() arguments are dead wrong
- All nested QFlags are incorrect in the parent class
    Example:

    class Qt:
        [...]
        AnchorLeft: Qt = ...

    [...]
    class AnchorPoint:
        AnchorLeft: AnchorPoint = ...

    The first declaration has an incorrect type

- QGuiApplication() and QApplication() are missing the instance() method
- all method in QCoreApplication are static ???
- all classes are missing signals
- some functions are decorated with @staticmethod !
- more tests from PyQt5-stubs



First Release:
==============
- CI running in GitHub
- setup.cfg working
- all platform specific stubs

Done:
====
- all tests from PyQt5 working
