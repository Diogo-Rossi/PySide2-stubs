General TODO:
=============
- some functions are decorated with @staticmethod !
- more tests from PyQt5-stubs
- explain how to make a new release
- create dev-requirements.txt


to check:
- Signal.connect() arguments are dead wrong
- QGuiApplication() and QApplication() are missing the instance() method
- all method in QCoreApplication are static ???



Won't do:
========
- run mypy locally on our stubs and fix errors
    => too many errors not fixable easily like empty containers type: List instead List[str], ...

Done:
====
- make it work: run pytest inside GitHub action
- explain how to add a new test
- explain how scripts/ work
- [done] add show error codes to mypy call
